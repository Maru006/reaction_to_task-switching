# reaction_to_task-switching
UPCOMING...a visualization of reaction-times across differnet response-conditions.

This project looks at other effective ways to visualize differences in observed pattern between conditions/environments. 

Although outright summary of statistics is the conventional approach to dissecting the effects of certain conditions, certain scenarios may require  to capture the magnitude of a comparison. More so when the subject or interpretations are difficult to imagine while it is involved 
in a complex investigation.
  
One idea was to combine statistical outputs with diagrams: where the axis represents output beyond central tendencies, and show relational 
representations. One example was to define axes comparisons with statistical output, such as the p-value between comparisons. 
  
Currently the conventional approach might be through correlating heatmaps, which shows the degree of change to an atribute of color or other nominal measurement. Perhaps, through the annotation of statistic in bar graphs between variables in the axes to achieve a desired comparison. 

But, one approach could also incorporate a spatial resolution when the conventional method does not sufficiently describe data. Such as when describing data to a 3rd dimension like time, change or exposure.... (to be continued).
