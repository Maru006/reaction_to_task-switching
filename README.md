# reaction_to_task-switching
UPCOMING...a visualization of reaction-times in response to a rule-switching task w/feedback or w/o feedback.

This project looks at other effective ways to visualize differences in observed pattern between conditions/environments. 

Although statistics is the conventional approach to disecting the effects of independent variables, it sometimes require an experienced eye or
  writer to convey the magnitude of this effect. More so when the subject or interpretations are difficult to imagine while being involved 
  in a complex investigation.
  
One idea was to combine statistical outputs with diagrams: where the axis represents output beyond central tendencies, and show relational 
  representations.
