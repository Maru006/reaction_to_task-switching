# reaction_to_task-switching
UPCOMING...a visualization of reaction-times across differnet response-conditions.

This project looks at other effective ways to visualize differences in observed pattern between conditions/environments. 

Although outright summary of statistics is the conventional approach to interpreting the effects of independent variables, some scenarios require the visualization of results to intuitively capture the magnitude of an effect. Especialy, when the subject must be simplified, but it is involved in a complex investigation.
    
Currently the approach might be through correlating heatmaps or simply XY scatter graphs, which shows the degree of change to an atribute of color or other nominal measurement respectively. Perhaps, through the annotation of statistic in bar graphs between variables in the axes to achieve a desired comparison. Circulating in published academia, is to combine statistical outputs with diagrams: where the axis represents output within central tendencies, along with annotions showing test statistic commonly in: Student T-tests or hypothesis testing by the p-value. 

However, it has yet to resolve the normally extended description that follows between diagrams because categorical or XY graphs offer only isolated and direct comparisons, an unfit attempt for storytelling in more complex investigations. For this reason, other approaches have incorporated the spatial resolution. Such as when a third dimension like time, change or exposure in a Z axis can be expressed. But this is usually innefective in 2D space of research papers or other written materials, often aggregating multiple measurements to one - removing more infrormation.

To address this subject, this project will compare a past paper in Psychology showing the conventional distribution of statistical and graphical storytelling, to the same paper inspired by new methods...
