# reaction_to_task-switching
UPCOMING...a visualization of reaction-times across differnet response-conditions.

This project looks at other effective ways to visualize differences in observed pattern between conditions/environments. 

Although outright summary of statistics is the conventional approach to dissecting the effects of certain conditions, some scenarios require the visualization of data to capture the magnitude of comparisons. Especialy, when the subject must be simplified but is involved in a complex investigation.
    
Currently the conventional approach might be through correlating heatmaps, which shows the degree of change to an atribute of color or other nominal measurement. Perhaps, through the annotation of statistic in bar graphs between variables in the axes to achieve a desired comparison. 

Circulating in published academia, is to combine statistical outputs with diagrams: where the axis represents output within central tendencies, along with the aforementioned annotion showing test statistic commonly in: Student T-tests or hypothesis testing by a p-value. 

But, one approach could also incorporate a spatial resolution when the conventional method does not sufficiently describe data. Such as when a third dimension like time, change or exposure needs to be address beyond static line graphs...
